a small app to upload shared files

made mostly for the purpose of sending memes via irc

### usage

- install it
- set the server to your server's url
- set the token to whatever's supposed to be send in `Authorization` header (i use a predefined string, but you can use `Bearer something` or even `Basic randombase64`)
- share files to the app
